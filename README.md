## 📦 Repository Contents

```
Python/
├── python-for-ai            # Python script (likely AI‑focused or practice code)
└── README.md                # Project documentation
```

> Replace `python-for-ai` with actual script names if you rename or add files. The contents depend on what Python code you populate the repo with.

## 💻 Getting Started

These steps help you run and explore the code locally.

### 📌 Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

* **Python 3.8+** — Recommended
* A code editor or IDE such as **VS Code**, **PyCharm**, or **Jupyter Notebook**

Verify Python installation:

```bash
python --version
```

---

### 📥 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shreyaspatil1008/Python.git
cd Python
```

2. **(Optional) Create a virtual environment**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```

This helps manage dependencies if you add any libraries later.

---

### ▶️ Running Python Scripts

To run a script, use:

```bash
python filename.py
```

Example:

```bash
python python-for-ai.py
```

> Ensure the `.py` extension matches your script file name.
